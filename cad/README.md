> [!IMPORTANT]
>The X ends idler and its tensioner are a working progress in this CAD file. They are **currently** not compatible with the previous X end idler and tensioner. The STL files exported into ../printed_parts/stl are a copy of the Bear extruder V1. The future revisions will make them compatible with the V1.
