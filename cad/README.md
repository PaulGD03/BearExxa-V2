# BearExxa V2

## CAD

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The X end idler and its tensioner are a working progress in these CAD files. They are **currently** not compatible with the previous X end idler and tensioner. The STL files exported into `../printed_parts/stl` are a copy of the Bear extruder V1 X ends ([source files of V1](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis/tree/master/source)). The future revisions will make them compatible with the V1.
